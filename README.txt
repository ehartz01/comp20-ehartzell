What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
	The purpose of this repository is to serve as a reference and testament to the different skills and concepts I learned, and things I created throughout this web programming course. 
What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
	My favorite assignment was probably the frontend part of the notuber project. It was cool to see the immediate effects my work and how easy it is to build something that uses several different parts.
How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
	I think that this course really exposed me to a lot of things I wouldn't have otherwise known or cared about had I just stuck to electives related to my cognitive science major. I also feel more ready to learn and teach myself new technologies.
What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
	I think in general just the basics of how the web really works were really important: the way requests and responses between client and server are structured and what they should or shouldn't contain.
Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
	I enjoyed a lot of the cyber security unit, and wish I had taken this class earlier in my undergrad so that I could take security as well.
